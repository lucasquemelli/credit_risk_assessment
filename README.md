# 1. Business Problem

**Description**

---

Credit default risk is the chance that companies/individuals cannot make the required payments on their debt obligations, which can lead to a possibility of loss for a lender. Earlier credit analysts would perform risk management by analyzing the borrowerâ€™s credentials and capabilities, but this was prone to errors. With the advent of Machine learning, ML algorithms can perform a credit risk assessment with better precision and much faster than any humans.

**Purpose**

---

To predict loan defaulters and minimize the risk of loss on the basis of credit history, employment, and demographic data.

# 3. Solution Strategy

**Step 01 - Data Description:** cleaning data, changing data type, treating missing values, check balance of data, and descriptive statistics.

**Step 02 - Feature Engineering:** creating new features that may better explain the phenomenon.

**Step 03 - Exploratory Data Analysis:** univariate analysis, bivariate analysis (hypotheses test).

**Step 04 - Dataset balance:** balancing dataset in order to avoid biases for some class.
 
**Step 05 - Data Preparation:** rescaling, encoding and transformation.

**Step 06 - Feature Selection:** feature selection based on feature importance analysis.

**Step 07 - Machine Learning Modelling:** testing and comparing Machine Learning models.

**Step 08 - Validation:** simulation of the prod environment.

# 4. Top 3 Data Insights

1. People with home ownership as rent was more prone to have defaulters.
2. People with very low and low income band represented the customers which were more prone to be a defaulter.
3. Mostly people which were more prone to be a defaulter was from high interest rate.
