**Description**

---

Credit default risk is the chance that companies/individuals cannot make the required payments on their debt obligations, which can lead to a possibility of loss for a lender. Earlier credit analysts would perform risk management by analyzing the borrowerâ€™s credentials and capabilities, but this was prone to errors. With the advent of Machine learning, ML algorithms can perform a credit risk assessment with better precision and much faster than any humans.

**Purpose**

---

To predict loan defaulters and minimize the risk of loss on the basis of credit history, employment, and demographic data.
